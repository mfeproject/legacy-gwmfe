The C source file `rules1.c` is generated by the yacc parser generator from
input file `rules1.y`:

    yacc rules1.y && mv y.tab.c rules1.c

Ideally the build system would treat the `rules1.c` as an intermediate file
that it automatically generates from the fundamental source file `rules1.y`.
CMake, however, doesn't natively include support for yacc. It has native
support for the modern yacc replacement, bison, through its FindBISON module
but unfortunately the existing `rules1.y` file is not compatible with bison.

Instead of going to the effort of developing a home-grown "FindYACC" CMake
module, I've opted to just include the yacc-generated `rules1.c` file in the
repository as the given source file for CMake and avoid yacc entirely. If
the parser specification `rules1.y` is modified, `rules1.c` will need to be
manually regenerated.
