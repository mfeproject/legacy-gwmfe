GP1 is a simple interactive visualization tool written specifically
for 1D MFE by Lee Busby (circa 1986).  The tek emulation mode available
through X11's xterm is used for on-screen display, and postscript is
used for hardcopy.  The program was originally developed and used on
the old Sun 3/50 SunOS workstations; it will likely require some
changes to build on other platforms, though the changes should be
reasonably straightforward for an experienced C programmer.

NNC, 22 Dec 2014.  Made several changes to make the code compilable again.
It works with GCC 2.8.3 and Intel 14.0.3 on 64-bit Linux (Fedora 20).
