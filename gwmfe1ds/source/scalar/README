By setting npde=1 in parameters.h, the systems code will work properly for
a scalar problem.  This will result in some unnecessary overhead due to some
dead loops, single-pass loops, and vestigial array indices, so modest
performance improvement could be obtained by stripping down the systems code
to a scalar-only version.
