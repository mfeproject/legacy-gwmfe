  o Added several config files for modern compilers under Linux.
  o Modernized GP1's use of system libraries; it compiles once again.
  o Changed the licensing terms to the MIT license.

Initial public release (March 1998) --
  Version 4.2 (1991) with minor changes:
  o Removed unnecessary system fluff (calls to clock, date, etc.) to improve
    portability.
  o Moved parameter declarations for array dimensioning to a single file that
    is included using the INCLUDE directive.
  o Improved treatment of Dirichlet boundary conditions.  This should fix the
    fatal anomalies that would occasionally occur.
