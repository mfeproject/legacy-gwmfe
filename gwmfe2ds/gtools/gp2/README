GP2 is a simple interactive visualization tool written specifically
for 2D MFE by Lee Busby (circa 1986).  The tek emulation mode available
through X11's xterm is used for on-screen display, and postscript is
used for hardcopy.  The program was originally developed and used on
the old Sun 3/50 SunOS workstations; it will likely require some
changes to build on other platforms, though the changes should be
reasonably straightforward for an experienced C programmer.

The directory "new-src" contains the final version produced by Lee Busby.
It corrected some bugs in the vector field routines.  Contour plotting,
however, was broken in this release, so the prior version -- that contained
in "src" -- is the most usable.

Update (12/23/2014, NNC).  I have made a number of modifications to the
C code, which continues to suffer bit rot, to return it to a working state.
While the code could use a substantial overhaul to make it ansi compliant,
I have limited the changes to just the essential ones.  In particular, the
code assumed in several instances that int and long have the same size,
whereas on current platforms long is twice as large.  This effected the
size of the header section.  The modified code has been tested with the
gcc 2.8.3 and Intel 14 and 15 compilers on 64-bit Linux (Fedora 20).

Notes
* Gp2 must be run from a Tektronix emulator.  The Tek emulation mode of
  xterm ('xterm -t') serves this purpose.
* Gp2 will invoke the programs gpp and gplot2 as subprocesses, and thus
  they need to be somewhere in your executable search path as defined by
  your PATH environment variable.
