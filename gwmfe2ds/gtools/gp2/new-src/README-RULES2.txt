The C source file `rules2.c` is generated by the yacc parser generator from
input file `rules2.y`:

    yacc rules2.y && mv y.tab.c rules2.c

Ideally the build system would treat the `rules2.c` as an intermediate file
that it automatically generates from the fundamental source file `rules2.y`.
CMake, however, doesn't natively include support for yacc. It has native
support for the modern yacc replacement, bison, through its FindBISON module
but unfortunately the existing `rules2.y` file is not compatible with bison.

Instead of going to the effort of developing a home-grown "FindYACC" CMake
module, I've opted to just include the yacc-generated `rules2.c` file in the
repository as the given source file for CMake and avoid yacc entirely. If
the parser specification `rules2.y` is modified, `rules2.c` will need to be
manually regenerated.
