Legacy GWMFE Codes of Carlson and Miller
----------------------------------------
The gzip-compressed archive files `gwmfe1ds.tgz` and `gwmfe2ds.tgz` contain
the final versions of the 1D and 2D gradient-weighted moving finite element
codes GWMFE1DS and GWMFE2DS. These Fortran 77 codes were used to produce the
results for a pair of 1998 SIAM journal papers [1,2].  The postscript files
`SISC26955.ps` and `SISC26956.ps` are pre-prints of those papers.

The visualization tools in the `gtools` subdirectory of the code archives
(written in C) have suffered bit rot, and no longer compiler on contemporary
platforms.  Use the updated versions from `gwmfe1ds-gtools.tgz` and
`gwmfe2ds-gtools.tgz` archive files.
